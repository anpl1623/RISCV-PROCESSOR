# rv32i cycle accurate model

This project was a comprehensive and extensive creation and implementation of 40 instructions on the Reduced Instruction Set Computer
(RISC-V) architecture, where I designed and debugged complete CPU functionality from
the ground up. Each instruction required specific pipelining which was modified
throughout the project, demanding meticulous attention to detail in handling data
hazards, control hazards, and forwarding mechanisms. Among each phase came
different levels of complications, intricacy, knowledge, and patience, particularly
when implementing complex instructions like branching and memory operations (loading and storing). The
project helped provide an in-depth understanding of how a RISC-V-based CPU would
progress throughout each clock cycle, including crucial concepts like instruction fetch,
decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages. The RISC-V architecture's
multi-stage-pipelined nature required careful consideration of timing constraints and
dependencies between instructions, giving me hands-on experience with real-world
CPU design challenges. This project not only enhanced my technical skills in hardware
description languages and digital design but also developed my problem-solving
abilities and resilience when faced with complex system-level challenges.
